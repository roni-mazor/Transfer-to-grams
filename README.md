# Transfer-to-grams
A google chrome extension i built that loops through a website and try to replace all the non grams measurement to grams.
If you find any problem or bug i would be very thankful if you report to me at ro6596@gmail.com.
The extension was deplyoed to the Chrom Web Store but havent been confirmed yet,if you are intrested in trying,download the files and upload it as is to chrome://extensions/ while in developer mode.
